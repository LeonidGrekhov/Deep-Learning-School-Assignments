I bought Amy in 2010 when my oldest child got his license. She was first owned  by a couple that relied upon her for their nanny to drive the children around. 

All of my children learned to drive with Amy and when the oldest graduated college I gifted Amy to him.  Now I am selling her for him as he has finally opted for a new car.

Amy has 197K miles but runs like a top and still looks decent for her age and miles. She has lost her cool (A/C doesn't work) which just didn't bother my son who didn't bother to fix it. I'm not interested in fixing it either so she'll come without working A/C.  She does however have almost brand new tires and has always received timely maintenance since we've owned her. I think she'll go for a long while still. 

My son and the title are in Roanoke but he'll come down to complete a transfer within a day or two for the buyer.

Come see her and drive her.  I won't ride with you and I'll need a copy of a valid driver's license for you to take her out.

Cash or cashier's check required to purchase.

This is a great vehicle that is amazing on gas. Everyone I know keeps saying they need a comfortable, reliable, great on gas sedan, well, here is is! This car rides and drives great, looks great, and even smells great on the inside! I have personally driven it hundreds of miles and continue to be impressed over and over with the performance and how cheap it is to drive! Going from a full size Duramax pick up to this car has been one of the most refreshing change of vehicles I have every had.
It is extremely comfortable and will easily transport five adults. The car has multiple safety features including front and side airbags and three rear child seat anchors. Each seat is also equipped with an adjustable headrest.

This car has all the high tech features you could want, including multiple charging outlets, USB and AUX ports, fingertip controls on the steering wheel for the radio, and cruise control. I even love the look of the interior of this dash. It is modern and easy to read. 

We have had this vehicle fully mechanically inspected, evaluated, and test driven without any issues.

While the car is in excellent condition, it does have some minor old age cosmetic wounds/imperfections. The sun roof started having trouble closing so has been left in the closed position but still functions as a moon roof. (It’s possible that it could be repaired, but I haven’t had anyone investigate.)

I am sad to let ‘The Limo’ go, but I have recently purchased an AWD vehicle for my move north. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

All the options work including, air conditioning, heat, power sliding doors, etc. The vehicle has been owned in North Carolina since new, has extensive service records, and clean title and Carfax history. The van has been sitting for the last year and not driven much. 

****Outside of the damage to the rear bumper, and general wear associated with the age and mileage, the vehicle has started to not run after about 15 minutes of driving it.  We have had the van looked at by several shops and given different answers each time. The general consensus is the catalytic converters have failed and are clogged. The vehicle can be driven 10-15 minutes before it will no longer accelerate. We are selling it as is since we were unable to get a clear answer to have it fixed.

The good:  Starts, moves, stops, all electronics and 4wd work as they should.

Transmission replaced roughly 50k miles ago. 

The bad:  serpentine belt blew while mom was on the interstate. She limped the car another 5 miles, turned it off and had it towed home when safe. During that 5 miles it overheated as one would expect, and when we checked the oil at home it’s low. 

Engine still turns over and will start, but seems low on power. Belt still needs to be replaced. Car will have to be towed. Great for someone to fix up or use for parts.

Tires and spare are in great shape.  178,000 miles, give or take...  I still drive it to town from time to time.

This truck is in great shape. It has a few dings here and there. Engine, Transmission, and 4 wheel drive work perfectly. I recently took it to a shop and had oil, transmission fluid, and brake fluid all drained and replaced. Back seat has fold down jump seats for two passengers in the back.

There is only one problem... Something is slowly draining the battery. If you crank it every day you will have no problem. If you keep a trickle charger on it you will have no problem... But, if you let it sit for more than 3 days the battery will go dead and you will have to jump it off. Probably an easy fix, but I am not a mechanic. But it does have a brand new battery from NAPA with a no questions asked warranty. I also removed the aftermarket stereo from the dash trying to see if that was causing the battery drain. That didn't fix the problem, but I bought a brand new stereo, still in the box, and I'll give it to you with the truck. 

Clean NC Title in Hand. No wrecks that I am aware of... Good strong truck!

$6000 cash...  Thanks for looking!

We are contemplating keeping it for our daugther's first car so we are interested in serious buyers only and will not entertain any low offers. 
I have 16 records showing regular maintenance and a spreadsheet to keep track of all service records. Powertrain is in great shape and I have recently upgraded some suspension parts. This summer Atlantic Tire replaced some front suspension components (receipt available). 
The tire pressure monitoring system is currently broken and I decided not to replace it until I need new tires. The tires are in good shape and do not need to be replaced immediately. That is the only item that I know of that is not working.

This is a 6 speed manual transmission, 6 cylinders, 4 wheel drive (low and high) or 2 wheel drive (RWD), finished in silver metallic and black cloth interior. The truck is equipped with 4 almost new Goodyear Wrangler tires, it comes with 2 front rubber mats, 2 rear cloth mats, a tow hitch and an original radio.

The truck is using a little bit of oil - common on this model - and the catalytic converters will need to be replaced in order to pass an emission test - hence the ""service engine soon"" light on the dash. Other than that there is nothing wrong with this pickup, everything is in working order.

This Nissan Frontier is in a pretty good shape overall. The interior is in a very good condition with no rips at all in the seats. The exterior of the pickup is in a good condition, as you can see on the pictures, there are a couple of scratches on the body and some of the paint peeled away on the A pillars. The central piece of the front bumper is cracked but the truck will come with a new one that will need to be installed as well as a new plastic cover to fit under the passenger headlight.

VIN:  1N6AD06W76C463438

Bought it 4-years ago as a daily driver, but bought a newer car and no longer use it. Had initially planned to restore it, so it has many new parts, but am moving out of state now and can't take it with me. It needs a new speed sensor, so the speedometer recently stopped working and the ABS/Brake light came on. It's a common problem, but I don't have time to fix it. Air conditioner works, but will need Freon before next summer. Third row seating, tow hitch, and roof luggage rack.

This vehicle is in exceelnt mechanical shape with like new frame and like new engine bay. The only cosmetic minor issue is the clearcoat on the roof only has begun to fade.

the following has been completed: Michelin tires with 99%tread. New battery and serpentine belt with trans fluid and rear diff changed. The spark plugs have been changed along with the PCV valve and air filter. New wiper blades. 

This 4Runner drives as new and runs very smoothly. No leaks or shakes at 75-80MPH. It gets 19MPG in town and about 21-22 on the highway.

The paint with the exception of the roof is excellent with a few very minor dings but no dents.

I am only selling to get something my wife can drive as we are both retired and she cannot handle the 4Runner

I can send pics only to a valid email address.

This si a great vehicle and has many miles left. Has a sunroof and also the JBL sound system that may need a new sub but I am not sure.

Bad things about this truck:
- The wipers don't work. I don't know why.
- The doors don't always unlock with the key fobs but the power lock buttons inside usually work.
- It's 22 years old.


Good things about this truck:
- Everything *but* the wipers are in good working order.
- 2 owners, both in the same family.
- Used for nothing but occasional horse trailer hauling for the first 20 years of its life, hence the low miles.
- Setup for towing with trailer and power connections at the rear.
- Body is in great condition with no rust.
- Rhino liner on the bed.


The truck works great but we don't need a truck in the suburbs. It needs to go haul heavy things somewhere for it to be happy. We're downsizing to a more family-sized car so we need to set the truck free, first. If you're able to give it a happy home, let us know.

34,"$6,995",Durham,2004 Toyota 4Runner Limited Sport Utility 4D,https://raleigh.craigslist.org/cto/d/research-triangle-park-2004-toyota/7556665547.html,Nov 12,"Sadly letting go of my 2004 Toyota 4 Runner Limited 4.0 liter/6 cyl. This car has been GOOD to me and I hope whoever takes it off my hands will love it as much as I have. Clean title and the only other owner was the family member I bought the car from.
In classic Toyota fashion, 4 Runners are known for their longevity and reliability. While she may have a lot of miles, I can assure you there is a ton of life left in this car. This car has seen me through life from San Diego to Durham and taken lots (and lots) of roadtrips without a single hiccup. Maintained and regularly serviced and all the records to prove it.
Full vehicle report available by request!

The Good:
- This is the limited edition with all the bells and whistles: heated leather seats, navigation, proper sound system, automatic sun roof, etc.
- All electronics in the truck work
- AC and heat both work swimmingly, cold is cold and hot is hot
- Tires are in excellent condition (replaced late 2020 with a 75,000 mile warranty)
- All spark plugs replaced last year
- New rotors (+ break pads) last year
- All mechanical fluids replaced within last year

The Bad:
- Passengers side front and rear window must be rolled up by controls on drivers side
- Tire pressure light is on, even though tire pressures are fine
- L blinker light needs replacing (blinking at super speed)
- Check engine light is on because catylyic converters need replacing. Light has been on since 2020 and I took it in for service to confirm that this was the only reason the light was on (have all service records from this). They cleaned out the cats and the check engine light stayed off for over a year, but it came back on a few months back. If you are registering it in an area that requires you to pass smog, they will need to be replaced in order to do so.
- Due for an oil change

The Ugly:
- Back R bumper has a cosmetic crack in it (see photos)
- Some oxidation of the paint
- Other usual signs of wear and tear (love)

Pretty firm on the price. Title in hand.

Good/excellent condition with 156,000 well maintained miles. Galactic Gray Mica with tan cloth power seats for both driver and passenger.
This vehicle is in exceelnt mechanical shape with like new frame and like new engine bay. The only cosmetic minor issue is the clearcoat on the roof only has begun to fade.

the following has been completed: Michelin tires with 99%tread. New battery and serpentine belt with trans fluid and rear diff changed. The spark plugs have been changed along with the PCV valve and air filter. New wiper blades. 

This 4Runner drives as new and runs very smoothly. No leaks or shakes at 75-80MPH. It gets 19MPG in town and about 21-22 on the highway.

The paint with the exception of the roof is excellent with a few very minor dings but no dents.

I am only selling to get something my wife can drive as we are both retired and she cannot handle the 4Runner

I can send pics only to a valid email address.

This si a great vehicle and has many miles left. Has a sunroof and also the JBL sound system that may need a new sub but I am not sure.
Please contact via email only.

It is a used truck so it has a little wear on the seat and some spots where lights were removed before we got it but overall this truck is in great condition and ready to work!

* Timing belt has been replaced twice, and car leaks oil from this area. My mechanic recommended that the timing belt  be replaced again to remedy the issue.
* NOTE: INFO ON CARFAX IS INCORRECT: car should not have an EML brand. It has the brand because of a mistaken entry stating that the car has a 5- digit odometer and rolled over. It's obviously a mistake, as you can see  6- digit odometer readings on the Carfax, plus here's a picture. I am working to correct it. I can show you emails if you like.


Things that don't work: 
* both Power windows 
* CD player (but you can have my bluetooth connector to stream stuff) Radio is fine
* AC (might just need recharging)
* Odometer display fades in and out
* Line for wiper fluid needs to be replaced

I don’t need to sell it, if I come up with enough money soon I will get it fixed and keep it.  Mileage is about 187,000.  I have the clean title in hand.  I have the third row seats as well in pristine condition.

The Jeep has 131,000 miles on it and has been used as a daily driver since we bought it last year.  We are selling the car and replacing it with a larger SUV.

Overall, the Jeep is in good condition.  The body has a few small dents/dings as well as a small spot of rust on the back.  There are some scratches on the plastic fenders as well.  The frame is solid and does not have rust or rot.  Mechanically, the car is great.  I have replaced many parts within the last year (about 10,000 miles); all listed below.  As far as I can tell, the car needs nothing.  I had the car coated with ceramic wax/sealant after I bought it.  I do have the original black shift knob if desired.  The Jeep has carpet and the back seat.  The Jeep has a solid front bumper with a winch.  The winch is fully functional and has a remote control.  I have never used it other than to test it out.  

The Jeep just passed the NC annual inspection and had the tires/wheels balanced. 

The radio is a Pioneer DMH-2660NEX with a microphone to allow hands-free calling.  It also supports Apple Car Play and Android Auto.  The speakers are all Rockford Fosgate and have been installed this year

The headlights have been replaced with J.W. Speaker LED headlights, which are amazing.  

The soft top was replaced with a Trektop® Glide™ Slantback by Bestop with the sunrider. The material is the premium black twill and has been cleaned and treated with Bestop's sealant. The glide feature makes the panels easily removable.  The Bestop storage bag is also included.  The bag holds all three panels in separate pouches to protect from scratches.

New parts, in addition to the few above:
Synthetic oil
Both differential fluids - Royal Purple synthetic
Transmission gear oil - Royal Purple Synthetic
Antifreeze
Spark plugs and wires
Battery
Brake fluid flush
Both exhaust manifolds, gaskets, and bolts
Intake manifold gaskets

Rock Sliders (to serve as a step to enter the Jeep)

Price does not include tax/tags/registration. We do not charge a dealer doc fee.  
We are not a buy here/pay here lot. Please arrange financing if needed. 

Our dealership uses a No-Haggle pricing policy on all of our pre-owned vehicles. We price our vehicles very competitively in the market to give you an extremely fair price right up front. We do not negotiate on the price of the vehicle. Most of our cars are priced well below fair market value. We have taken many factors into consideration when pricing our inventory: exterior and interior condition, mileage, accident history, and remaining warranty just to name a few. Our cars are priced in the condition that you see them. As with any used vehicle, they have been driven on the road, parked in garages and parking lots and driven through all kinds of weather. Some wear and tear is normal. This may include some small scratches or door dings, interior wear, chips in the windshield etc. We have taken all of these into consideration and priced the vehicles accordingly. All vehicles must pass North Carolina State inspection. Cars come with one key unless otherwise noted or disclosed. Not all cars have second keys. Not all cars have owners manuals. We will be happy to price any parts or repairs that you may desire at our wholesale cost.

Needs:

The car drives, but the driver needs to press the clutch all the way to the floor in order to shift gears.  I would recommend replacing the clutch.  Parts Geek sells a new clutch kit for approximately $350 that matches the numbers (2.4L L5 B5244S4) for this car.

This car currently starts to ride ""rough"" around 50 mph.  I don't know what causes it to do this, so I usually just keep it under 50 mph.  One mechanic suggested the tires need to be realigned, but this is only a guess.  I'll look into getting this work done and I'll revise this listing if I'm able to resolve this issue.

The emergency brake doesn't really work.  I usually keep the car parked on a level surface.  If necessary, I put the car in 1st gear when it's parked.

The passenger right tail light housing / assembly should be replaced.  I think this costs less than $100 pre-owned on eBay.

The backseat right window doesn't roll down automatically and needs to be held in place (I've been using tape).  It's possible that the window simply needs to be reattached inside the door.

The upholstery, especially the interior ceiling of the car, probably needs to be replaced or repaired.

- The windows are electric and work great
- Sunroof works great
- We will get the car cleaned and washed right before we sell!
- Radio works great
- Bluetooth radio adaptor included

Known Problems:
- The known problems are that it won't pass state inspection due to an air leak on the exhaust under the car.
- I think the car also needs freon because the AC is low but the heat works great

Owned since Feb 2016.  Weekend car driven 30,000 miles over past 6-1/2 years.  Bought this for my wife as her 2nd car, and I performed a complete Preventive Maintenance service at 60,000 miles as I wanted to help insure she had zero concerns driving around the Triangle and occassional trips to Wilmington.  This is a quick summary of the work I performed: new rear wheel hubs, front and rear pads, rotors, fluid, new fuel pump assy with fuel filter, water pump, radiator fluid & hoses, heater hoses, power steering hoses & reservoir, oil change for the Eaton supercharger, new aluminum radiator overflow tank, new coil, spark plugs and wires.   All of this work performed in my shop to prevent future concerns.  Car is extremely reliable and ready for the next owner!

Synthetic 5W-30 oil and new filter replaced every 5-6,000 miles. 

Transmission fluid replaced Dec 2018, and cabin air filter in Dec 2019.  New front strut upper mounts in May 2020.  New run flat Hankook tires in July 2020.  Last oil change and front brake pads and pad wear sensor in August 2022.

New Kenwood AMFMCD stereo, Kenwood amp, and JL Audio component speakers replaced MINI stereo in June 2020.   17” Rota RB wheels with polished lips, Hankook performance tires, H&R lowering coil springs, and MILTEK stainless steel cat-back exhaust.   MINI sits approx 1” lower.  I have all the original wheels, coil springs, and exhaust system if the buyer should want these items.

MINI Cooper S has 6 speed Aisin automatic transmission, not the CVT auto in regular Coopers of the day.  Cold A/C, Cruise Control, PW, PDL, Power Top, optional chrome exterior package, optional gauge package, Astro Black Metallic over Malt Brown English leather.  Also has bi-xenon headlights with washers, fog lamps, rain sensing windshield wipers, heated front seats, and power folding side mirrors, The Sidewalk Edition was a two-year only production (2007 and 2008) and part of the very end of the R52 MINI Convertible – the first series of new MINIs.

Car has some small rock chips and minor scratches that one could expect on a 15 year-old car.

If the MINI is listed, it is still available.   And no, I do not need help marketing this car for sale.

17,"$3,500","Raleigh, NC",2004 Saturn Vue AWD V6,https://raleigh.craigslist.org/cto/d/raleigh-2004-saturn-vue-awd-v6/7552838191.html,Nov  2,"Selling a good-condition 2004 Saturn Vue AWD 3.5L V6. Premium vehicle: leather interior, heated seats, power/keyless everything. This is a Saturn with a Honda drivetrain! Entire engine, transmission, transfer case, all Honda! In the early years after GM bought Saturn they tried moving all Saturn components over to their chassis and ran into problems, as a result they had to source their drivetrains from Honda. As a result, you're getting the components of a Honda Pilot for the price of a domestic SUV! I've owned the vehicle since 2015 and can attest to its Honda-esque reliability.

The great:
New front brakes: pads and rotors*
New front bearings*
New battery*
* All within the last month, 1,000 miles
Tires in great shape (see photos for tread depth) and just rotated
Aftermarket hitch and wiring harness - haven't towed much but it can haul fully lighted trailers

The good:
Interior 6/10 (some cracked leather, very few tears)
Exterior 6/10 (some scratches, few dents)
Bluetooth stereo
Mileage below-average, 180K. I'm still driving around, so this may go up a bit.
2 keys and remotes
20-25MPG, pretty good for a 3.5L V6 engine with AWD!

The bad:
Check engine codes P0420 (catalytic converter), P0300-0305 (misfires across all cylinders)
I've been getting the P0420 code for a few years, I've been getting inspection waivers annually because the cost to fix is >$200. The misfire codes are relatively new (within the last 3 months)

Asking $3,500 OBO.

Truck has 238K on it. It runs very well with no known issues at this time. Ice cold ac. Transmission shifts smooth and four wheel drive works as it should. This truck has been in North Carolina since new but it is still 22 years old. Please take this into consideration. Not a perfect truck but in very good shape for the age and mileage.

Car runs good and is in overall decent shape. Interior and exterior are both pretty good with no major issue, just rough paint and some peels in the tint. The Fog light bezzle/insert on the passengers side is bust but repairable.

I put a GMPP clutch with LSJ TOB in about 600 miles ago as well as a stainless clutch cable, clutch master cylinder, and new clutch pedal. 
I also put FE5 end link in at the same time as the clutch
Has a new set of tires, nothing fancy, but they are new. 
No mechanical issues other than an exhaust leak at the header that I haven't had a chance to fix.

If it's posted, it's available. If you are interested in test driving, please know how to operate a manual. If you don't, that's fine but I'll be doing the driving.

Issues to bring up front: rebuilt title when I bought this car from dealer; turn signal can't turn off automatically (replacin spring will fix this, cost about $70); driver door sometimes can't lock well; random noise in reverse (replacing a filter will fix this). Since I already bought a new car, don't want to keep both or spend more money on old car

the following has been completed: Michelin tires with 99%tread. New battery and serpentine belt with trans fluid and rear diff changed. The spark plugs have been changed along with the PCV valve and air filter. New wiper blades. 

This 4Runner drives as new and runs very smoothly. No leaks or shakes at 75-80MPH. It gets 19MPG in town and about 21-22 on the highway.

The paint with the exception of the roof is excellent with a few very minor dings but no dents.

I am only selling to get something my wife can drive as we are both retired and she cannot handle the 4Runner

I can send pics only to a valid email address.

This si a great vehicle and has many miles left. Has a sunroof and also the JBL sound system that may need a new sub but I am not sure.

Car is located in Cary. 
Does not run. I suspect it’s a timing issue. (No compression) It’s been garage kept and collecting dust. Interior is in excellent condition. Few minor scratches in paint and some sun fading on spoiler, as expected for a nearly 18 year old car. 

Comes with miscellaneous goodies: Cobb access port (installed), new left and right front lips from Subaru, new gates high performance timing belt and water pump with component kit, new timing belt tensioner and crank pulley tool.  Brand new custom weathertech car cover with cable and lock that fits the big spoiler.  

Hate to let her go but I’m military and stationed on west coast and don’t have the time to fix. feel free to ask me any questions about it or send me your offers
