We ordered this Toyota from Modern Toyota of Boone to get three things: 1) made in Japan (the best reliability), 2) V6 engine - 269 HP, and 3) 3rd row (seats 7).  You cannot get any of that in a RAV4 now.  No V6. No 3rd row.  None of the gas RAV4's are made in Japan now.  Serviced regularly at Modern Toyota/Subaru except for 3 years in Raleigh.  It has been a very reliable family car for us.  No accidents, but we did crack the bumpers by bumping trees and posts.  We replaced both bumpers and added stainless steel rails to protect the new bumpers.  Within the last few months, we had several things fixed to prepare the car for sale - water pump, master brake cylinder, wheel bearings, and a tire pressure sensor.  Prior to those repairs, the only non-maintenance repairs (brake pads, rotors, etc.) that we had were the water pump (a weakness in this V6 engine) and an emissions sensor.  Not bad for 13+ years and almost 176,000 miles.  We have and can share service receipts back to 2009.

The car accelerates and drives very well.  It has no mechanical issues as far as we know, and we have had it checked thoroughly at Modern Subaru.  The after-market fog lights are not working because we cannot find a replacement relay for them.  But - because there's always a ""but"" - our RAV4 is very rusty underneath and on two rear panels (see photos).  They use a lot of salt on the roads where we live.  If you are comfortable dealing with rust, this could be a great car for you.

If you are interested in the car, text us at the number below.  It might take a while, but we will get back to you.
